How the Code Works
1.	Class Definition (CustomMultiSelect):
  •	The CustomMultiSelect class encapsulates all the logic for the dropdown component.
  •	It initializes the component, binds event listeners, manages accessibility attributes, and provides public methods for interaction.
2.	Features:
  •	Multi-Select and Single-Select Modes: Controlled by the singleSelect option.
  •	Search Functionality: Filters options dynamically based on user input.
  •	Select All/Deselect All: Available in multi-select mode.
  •	Keyboard Navigation: Supports arrow keys, Enter, Escape, and Space for navigation and selection.
  •	Accessibility: Implements WAI-ARIA attributes for screen readers.
  •	Dynamic Options Loading: Options can be loaded dynamically via the loadSelectOptions method.
3.	Initialization:
  •	The constructor sets up the component by merging default options with user-provided ones, binding event listeners, and initializing the UI.
4.	Event Handling:
  •	Events like clicks, key presses, and input changes are handled to provide interactivity.
  •	For example, clicking the display button toggles the dropdown, and typing in the search input filters the options.
5.	Public API:
  •	Methods like showComponent, hideComponent, getSelectedValues, and setSelectedValues, onChange event, disable, enable allow external control of the component.
6.	jQuery Plugin:
       The $.fn.customMultiSelect function allows the component to be initialized on any jQuery element.
